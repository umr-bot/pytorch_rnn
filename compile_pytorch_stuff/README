Used viable/strict branch to compile the wheel in this directory.
Run pytorch_env_vars to set up environment variables for setup.py.
Versions of required softwares are as follows:
    cuda-11.4, cudnn-8, gcc-10, g++-10, python-3.11
After running pip install pytorch_wheel_name.whl link libstdc++.so.6
of anaconda virtual environment to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6,
to remove GLIBXX version error.

# Side note: I had to first use gcc-7,g++-7 to start setup.py compilation
# then when build failed, switch to gcc-10,g++-10 and rerun setup.py
# without cleaning build directory to compile a working build without
# compilation throwing errors.
